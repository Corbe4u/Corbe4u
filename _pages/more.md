Wow, congrats on finding here! As you may see it, this place is far from void, but full of vim (lol) and vigor.  
This page is essentially a timeline of Computer Science-related events in my life, which I kept for personal record, but you might be interested about them.

### 2020
- Began to complete projects of [Pintos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintos), a instructional operating system for X86 instruction set architecture.
- Began to do the [CMU labs](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html) for practice and review [*CSAPP*](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/).
- Regenerated my blog with jekyll ([this site](https://charlesj.me)) but did not migrate all the stuff and posts yet.
- My Subversion server was about to expire and since Github provides unlimited free private repo, I started to migrate my projects and codes to [Github](https://github.com/serach24). 
- Attended my first Hackathon, [**Hack the Valley**](https://hackthevalley.io/). We put a lot of efforts into it to build a game in Unity, called [**RollABall**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e6Dj9I2jI) yet the teammate who was responsible to presenting and submitting forgot to submit our work. Oops.
- Missed NES games in the childhood (I especially love the [chiptune music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune)), so I wrote a [**Nintendo Entertainment System emulator**](https://github.com/serach24/NES-Emulator) (including audio!) in Java , which was quite complicated. It requires to read a lot of wikis and guides, but the good thing is, there are plenty of resources online, since it has been so many years (though there were still parts that I could only practice trial and error). It took me about three months and many sleepless night. Could not express how I feel when it succeeded. 

### 2019
- Started a toy operating system project called [**CharlOS**](https://github.com/serach24/CharlOS), just like my name, with the help of *OS自作入門* (it was written by Japanese and seems there was no English edition so had to read with Google Translator) and [**Bran's Tutorial**](http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/gettingstarted.htm). It is still in progress. 
- Migrated my blog to github page since it is free and convenient, generated the page with hexo and customized the theme.
- Got a software developing internship in the summer. Learned a lot about how a mature company works, how to collaborate with different roles (clients, Project Manager, designers, other developers) and what the industry look like. Yet the job was very stressing since our team almost missed the due date of the project even though it had already been extended.
- Got into UTSC CS Specialist POSt, did not transfer to UTSG because it suddenly changed the requirements, meaning I could not use UTSC first year courses as POSt but had to take those courses at UTSG again, or I could go to UTSG to study Maths or Data Science or Cognitive Science stuff and take CS as minor. Although I had a great interest in Maths as well, Computer Science is my true love and Co-op is not bad.
- A young friend in IB school asked me if I could write a web apllication for students in his school since the online resources are dispersed which he found very inconvenient. So I built [**ExamDrive**](https://github.com/serach24/ExamDrive) using with SpringBoot and Vue.js. It had 300 student users at the most.
- Wrote the [**MIDI harmonizer**](https://github.com/serach24/midi-harmonizer) for a course assignment, but since it was based on Binary Search Tree, I rewrote the Red and Black Tree version of it to make it more efficient when the music input is long. 
### 2018
- Knew about Lisp from my friends in UWaterloo (they learned Racket, a dialect of Lisp in the first year CS course), so I learned Scheme by myself and read *SICP (Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs)*. I really like the lambda calculus.
- Wrote a tool to count the keyword frequency and user mentions in tweets and tried to build a user relationships and hobbies network, since I did not had knowledge in machine learning then, what I did was quite naive and inaccurate.
- Became interested in Computer Systems, so I started to read *CSAPP (Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective)*.
- Thought cmd terminal was quite inconvenientm, so I planned to create a new terminal in windows, but found there was quite a few, so instead I wrote a [**Moch-Shell**](https://github.com/serach24/Mock-Shell) in Java to get familiar how it works
- First year CS and Maths courses were quite simple and boring since I learned most of stuff in primary school and junior school. Yet they refused to let me take high level courses without taking those courses. 
- Got offer from UTSC CS Co-op, for I made the decision to go to university in Canada quite late, I missed the UTSG application, so I planned to transfer to UTSG in second year. The thing is, though I had the oppotunity, I did not choose UWaterloo because I was told if one wants to go to graduate school, one should choose UofT CS over Waterloo CS. It is impossible to say I am not regret, but what has done is done.

### 2017
- Built up and maintained a forum using PHP for students (mostly my friends) to discuss Maths, CS-related problems and entrepreneurship ideas. 
- Started to use WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux), it was all good though it did not support docker.
- Wrote a crawler in Python, managed to designed one and received about 1 million questions and answers on Stackoverflow.

### 2016
- Saw many arguments on Python and Ruby, so I tried to learn them both. As a matter of fact, Ruby redefined the concept of OOP in my mind. Before I knew Ruby, I thought OOP is just about classes, inheritance, encapsulation and stuff, but Ruby syntax is very close to the daily English and far more than that in terms of freedom. Python is also a good language that focuses more on solving problems instead of the syntax, but I mainly used it to write crawlers and small tools and scripts.
- Rented a Subversion server to have version control for my codes (Github private repo was not free and a little bit expensive and Subversion was good enough for personal use).
- Rented a server to build a self-use VPN.
- Rewrote my blog with JQuery, which I learned in several minutes (To be honest, anyone who knows Vanilla JS can pick it up easily, all one needs is reading the official document)
- Learned JavaScript seriously in 2 weeks, mainly about its special features compared to other languages (it was a little messy as I see it). 
### 2015
- Start my own blog page, at first used Wordpress (I like it because it is undoubtedly a great product which allow people to start a website very quickly).
- Gave up on Pascal (I learned it only for algorithm contests) and changed to C and C++ (we joked that in terms of how we used it, C++ was actually C with STL since we mainly used it to attend algorithm contests wtih only C++ standard library and C features). Learned Qt later and found it quite what I looked for, so I rewrote the VB scientific calculator in C++ and Qt, and added the functionality to solve linear equations with one variable.
- Kept practicing algorithm problems like Dynamic Programming, attended Provincial Informatics Olympics and won a prize.
### 2014
- Learned windows BATCH script and wrote a windows management tools, at first it was designed to kill monitorign processes in the computer courses so that I could act freely and do whatever, and later I added many other functionalities such as cleaning cache, changing network settings and logging in/out VPN server for fun and added a great interface in Command line.
- Hacked the tablet by flashing a customized recovery and installed an Android launcher modified by myself.
- Wrote a scientific calculator in VB (included majority of functionalities of Windows 7 Calculator)
- Made a complicated Pinball game in VB to pay tribute to *Full Tilt! Pinball: Space Cadet*, one of my favourite games on PC in my childhood.
- Learned Visual Basic, kind of satisfied me for a while since it is easy to create GUI programs with it, but I lost my interest soon since it was too simple to me. 
### 2013
- Added a backdoor in the original launcher and so I could still have free access after the tablet was inspected by the tech crew.
- Tried to decompile the apk of the original launcher designed for educational purpose in the tablet, got to know some useful tools like ApkTool and dex2jar and learned Java in the process
- Got to know ubuntu and managed to install it on the class computer, but I was ordered to change Windows back since teachers did not know how to use ubuntu.
### 2012
- Received an thinkpad tablet for class teaching, which was installed a closed environment that only allows us to read slides and write e-homeworks there (we cound not even use browser), but I manually found one bug and managed to get its processes stuck and killed in order to access to the real Android environment
- Changed to use Free Pascal, which is another blue window. People said there was a huge advantage compared to Turbo Pascal, but two seemed the same to me at that time. 
### 2011
- Read about JavaScript, I did not realize JavaScript is a programming language at that time, and since I could write some simple HTML and CSS and use Dreamweaver proficiently, good enough to show off to my friends, it did not attract me.
- Started programming in Pascal, used Turbo Pascal at that time, which was just a blue window.
- Began to learn programming, what I thought of programming was to create something visible or with a graphic UI if put in today's language, but what I actually learned were mainly algorithms and data structures, and I had to practiced a lot of related problems, I was tricked.
