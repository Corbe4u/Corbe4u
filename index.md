Hey, I'm Charles!

I usually go by the handle `serach` or `Corbe4u`.

I'm in my 3rd year studying **Computer Science** (Specialist in Software Engineering) and **Math** major at [**University of Toronto**](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

My major interests are algorithms, software engineering, systems and compilers.  
If you're interested, you can check my [projects](/project/).
