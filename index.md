Hey, I'm Charles!

I usually go by the handle `serach` or `Corbe4u`.

I'm in my 3rd year studying **Computer Science** (Specialist in Software Engineering Co-op) at [**University of Toronto**](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

My major interests are software engineering and systems.  
If you're interested, you can check my [projects](/project/) or my [resume](/resume/).
